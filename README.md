# Split The Bill
## Project Proposal

My project is called **Split The Bill**. This program will help users by keeping track of shared costs amongst a group 
of individuals by:
- Creating a list of people
- Creating a list of expenses
- Tracking the cost of each expense
- Tracking who paid for an expense
- Tracking who an expense should be split between

The program will help manage shared bills by calculating the total amount paid by each individual, the total share of 
spending for each individual, and the outstanding payable or receivable balance.
This program can be used by friends and families that engage in any type of activities together that involves shared
costs among 2 or more individuals. Examples include hosting a home party, visiting an amusement park, 
seeing a movie, and dining out. This program will be especially useful to manage bills shared when travelling together
with a group of people as there will be various types of bills paid by different individuals with the cost intended to 
be split in different ways, which can make tracking complex.

This project is of interest to me because it solves problems that I encounter in my everyday life.
I often go out with friends where cost sharing is required but in most cases, it's not feasible to rely on the venue to 
split the bill accurately, while some venues don't offer this service at all.
Money is a sensitive topic for many individuals, and I believe that maintaining proper records of shared expenses is 
crucial for preserving long-term relationships with friends and family.
For example, when I eat out with my friends, I always want to make sure that I am paying my fair share of the bill. 
At the same time, I don't want to be seen as the person that drills deep into the 
receipt every time to ensure I wasn't charged for the beer that my friend ordered. This isn't a huge
problem if it was a one-time thing, but I will probably hang out with these friends again and the same thing is likely 
going to happen because I don't drink alcohol whereas many of my friends do. Over time, this can lead to tension and 
unnecessary negative feelings. The *Split The Bill* program intends to prevent these issues by making it easy and 
convenient to manage cost splitting amongst friends and families.
